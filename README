WHAT IS IT?

RenRot is a program to rename and lossless rotate for JPEG format files,
according to their EXIF tags.

For prevent incorrect associations some explanations are needed here. The name
of project is short form of 'REName and ROTate' and no other interpretation
will be used.

RenRot is intended to work  with files of B<--ext> extention, containing 
EXIF date and can do two things with them - rename and rotate. It runs in batch
mode in current or set with B<--work-directory> directory, as well as selective
mode for separate files, set with single or multiply B<--files>, or everything
after B<-->.

New template ideology was implemented. It includes flexibility in file name
construction. In version 0.16 and later the previous behaviour still present
with default NameTemplate. The template can contain different data, from
direct name to EXIF data (the date, id or shooting details such as
WhiteBalance, ISO e.t.c.). For further information, please, see applied
manual.

RenRot rotates file and its thumbnail, according to EXIF tag Orientation. If
the tag is absent or miss set, than the script allows to rotate the file as
well as it's thumbnail "by hands".

Furthermore, the script put a comment to:
    - Comment tag if comment file provided with --comment-file option
    - UserComment tag if $COMMENTARY variable set in configuration file

Personal data could be specified via XMP tags defined in configuration file.

In addition RenRot can aggregate all files in directories according the given
date/time pattern template, set with --aggr-template.

WHY RenRot?

Several projects like RenRot are available in the net, but why to choose
namely RenRot? Because:
    - it does just what it would do - renames and rotates, nothing more than
      that;
    - it is pure CLI with all it's advantage (no need KDE or any other monster
      to run);
    - it uses Image::ExifTool (the best open tool to work with EXIF data) and
      libjpeg6 (the best open tool to operate JPEG format files, to correctly
      rotate both, the very file and the thumbnail inside it);
    - it has very much flex file naming template engine;
    - it has very much flex file aggregation template engine;
    - it works in batch mode.


GETTING

RenRot home page is an ftp site for now. You can download script package from
the following sites:
 ftp://ftp.dn.farlep.net/pub/misc/renrot/ (home)
 ftp://andriy.asplinux.com.ua/pub/people/andy/renrot/ (mirror)
 ftp://ftp.asplinux.ru/ (looking for renrot package in RPM)


RUNNING

After installation process was done renrot is being running by typing
its name in console as usual. The next several examples provide general
applications of the script:
    rename each file according to the given template
	renrot --name-template="01.%c.%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%i.%E%F%W%I" --ext JPG

    rename each file according to the given template and files aggregation
    according the date
	renrot --name-template="%y%m%d%H%M%S.%i" --aggr-template "%Y%m%d" --ext JPG

    rotate each file and their thumbnail by 90CW in specified directory
	renrot --rotate 90 --ext '*.jpg' --work-directory="/tmp/images"

    rotate thumbnails, included to EXIF, for each file by 90CCW
	renrot --rotate-thumb 270 --ext jpg

    fix file mtime according to its EXIF tags or current time stamp, when tags
    are invalid
	renrot --norotate --norename --ext '*.jpeg' --mtime

    to leave mtime untouched
	renrot --ext 'jpg' --nomtime

    aggregate files by YYmmddHH 
	renrot --ext 'jpg' --aggr-template '%y%m%d%H'

RESTRICTIONS

RenRot has some restrictions at runtime. First off, script handles a
whole directory without recursion and only with one extension of files.
Second, algorithm treat each file with given extension as the image.
Otherwise, file will be renamed to the current time stamp when --no-rename
option is omitted.


DEBUGGING

For advanced users and developers renrot provides debug interface. Amount of
-v options in a command line defines level of verbosity. So script differs the
nine levels of debugging such as:
    from 1 till 4 - internal levels
    from 5 till 9 - equal to 1-5 levels for ExifTool plus maximum verbosity for
                    renrot


INSTALLATION

You can install renrot to make it available for use by other users by
typing the following:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local
    make
    make install PREFIX=/usr/local

Notes:
   i) You need root access for the last step above.
  ii) Some Perl installations (like the standard OSX installation) may not
      contain the necessary files to complete the first step above. But no
      worries: You can install script manually by moving 'renrot' to any
      directory in your current PATH.
 iii) You may choose any desired PREFIX by changing /usr/local at above
      sample.
