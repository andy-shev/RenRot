WHAT IS IT?

RenRot is a program to rename and lossless rotate for JPEG format files,
according to their EXIF tags.

For prevent incorrect associations some explanations are needed here. The name
of project is short form of 'REName and ROTate' and no other interpretation
will be used.


GETTING

RenRot home page is an ftp site for now. You can download script package
from the following sites:
 ftp://ftp.dn.farlep.net/pub/misc/renrot/ (home)
 ftp://andriy.asplinux.com.ua/pub/people/andy/renrot/ (mirror)
 ftp://ftp.asplinux.ru/ (looking for renrot package in RPM)


RUNNING

Renrot is intended to work ONLY in current directory with all files of
the extention, specified after --ext.

It renames files according to a picture date. The picture date is
defined like this:
- if DateTimeOriginal EXIF tag exists, it is used as the picture date
- otherwise, if FileModifyDate EXIF tag exists, it is used as the
  picture date
- otherwise current timestamp is used as the picture date.
Final file name will look like YYYYmmddHHMMSS.XXXX.jpg, where XXXX is
incrementable suffix to the name YYYYmmddHHMMSS.

New template ideology was implemented. It includes flexibility in file name
construction. In version 0.16 and later the described behaviour still present
with default NameTemplate. For futher information, please, see applied manual.

renrot rotates file and its thumbnail, accordingly to Orientation EXIF
tag. If the tag is absent or miss set, than the script allows to rotate
the file as well as it's thumbnail.

Futhermore, the script can put a comment to:
    - Comment tag if comment file provided with --comment-file option
    - UserComment tag if $COMMENTARY variable set in config file

Personal data could be specified via XMP tags defined in config file

Examples:
    rename according to given template
	renrot --name-template="01.%c.%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%i.%E%F%W%I" --ext JPG

    rotate all files by 90CW in specified directory
	renrot --rotate 90 --ext '*.jpg' --work-directory="/tmp/images"

    rotate thumbnails for all files included to EXIF by 90CCW
	renrot --rotate-thumb 270 --ext jpg

    fix file mtime accordingly to its EXIF tags or, when last are invalid, use
    current timestamp
	renrot --no-rotate --no-rename --ext '*.jpeg' --mtime


DEBUGGING

For advanced users and developers renrot provides debug interface. Amount of
"-v" options in a command line defines level of verbosity. So script differs
the nine levels of debugging such as:
    from 1 till 4 - internal levels
    from 5 till 9 - equal to 1-5 levels for ExifTool plus maximum verbosity for
                    renrot


INSTALLATION

You can install renrot to make it available for use by other users by
typing the following:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local
  make
  make install PREFIX=/usr/local

Notes:
   i) You need root access for the last step above.
  ii) Some Perl installations (like the standard OSX installation) may not
      contain the necessary files to complete the first step above. But no
      worries: You can install script manually by moving 'renrot' to any
      directory in your current PATH.
 iii) You may choose any desired PREFIX by changing /usr/local at above
      sample.
