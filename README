RUNNING

Renrot is intended to work ONLY in current directory with whole files of
the --ext extention.

It renames files according the DateTimeOriginal EXIF tag if it's exists
than if it isn't, according the FileModifyDate EXIF tag if it's exists
than if it isn't, the name will be given according the current timestamp
and will look as YYYYmmddHHMMS-XXXXX.jpg where XXXXX is incrementable 
suffix to the name YYYYmmddHHMMS.

It rotates file and it's thumbnail, accordingly Orientation EXIF tag.
If the tag is absent or miss set, than the script allows to rotate the file
as well as it's thumbnail,

After all, the script can put the commentary to:

	- Commentary tag if commentary file provided with --comment-file option

	- UserComment tag if $COMMENTARY variable set in config file

Personal data could be specified via XMP tags defined in config file

INSTALLATION

You can install the renrot to make it available for use by other users by
typing the following:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local
  make
  make install PREFIX=/usr/local
	    
Notes:
   i) You need root access for the last step above.
  ii) Some Perl installations (like the standard OSX installation) may not
      contain the necessary files to complete the first step above. But no
      worries: You can install script manually by moving 'renrot' to any
      directory in your current PATH.
 iii) You may choose any desired PREFIX by changing /usr/local at above
      sample.
