TODO SEMANTICS

-	not yet
+-	partialy done
+	already done
?	needs to be checked
q	optional feature


EXIF tags

+  to write to some tag sometning like "Processed with RenRot"

q  to write to some tag the options passed to renrot

+- to review XMP tags related code

q  to implement %t in name template, where the array of desired tags will be inited

+- smart rotation of Orientation tag (where used --only-orientation)


Disk I/O

+  to implement work with separate files rather than with whole directory

-  decrease disk IO operations as possible

-  to implement possibility to work with other formats, which use EXIF
   mechanism (conversions by ImageMagick and/or netpbm as well as jpegtran)

+  remove hardcoded '.jpg' extension

+- implement aggregation option (to aggregate large bundle of files
   according the different time intervals, perhapse with some kind of
   euristics for analyzing the bigest time interval between shots)

q  to write intellectual aggregation on clisp

-  to fix the feature with --aggr-template SOMENAME, when SOMENAME is dumb
   name, no % character and than renrot moves all to SOMENAME directory it'll
   be called OUTDIR

-  to implement possibility to work with several IN directories and to
   output to the set of OUT directories

+  to implement --no-mtime, and put it to the config

-  avoid hard link making where in and out files on different partitions


File naming

+  to implement possibility to add patterns for file naming ( to make it
   possible to name files in a different ways, YYYYMMDDHHmmSS, YYMMDDHHmmSS
   e.t.c.)

+  to make the file name counter format of the dynamic length, according
   the files number in the directory to process, it means NN for the number
   less than 100, e.t.c.

-  to add --counter-from option to let counting start from any desired number
   and add --counter-step


Verbosity

+  to complete verbose output option implementation

q  to implement progress indicator or spinning indicator


Other

-  UTF8fy (comments, tags, ...) since it's not implemented in ExifTool yet

?  to write the function 'on/off validator' NO NEED SINCE IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN
   getOptions()

-  to tune style look of comments, code e.t.c.

+- to review the code to optimize it where it's possible.
