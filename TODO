TODO SEMANTICS

-	not yet
+-	partialy done
+	already done
?	needs to be checked
q	optional feature


BUGS

-  fix cleaning RenRotFileNameOriginal while rotating file, previously renroted
   (reported by Alex Zasypkin)

+  fix cleaning EXIFs when --no-backup is given

-  make possible to use same EXIF tags in different groups


EXIF tags

q  to write to some tag the options passed to renrot

+- to implement %t in name template, where the array of desired tags will be
   inited


PLUGINS

-  plugin interface implementation (EXIF data transfer variant)

-  print some text on image (i.e. date and timestamp) [guess perl-GD will be
   optional requrement]

-  special effects (thumbnail layering over the image e.t.c.)

-  jpgfromraw

-  index page (from thumbnailimages)

-  shrinking e.t.c.

-  image hystogramm creation

q  split EXIF -> xml, to extract EXIF data from file original to the separate
   files and to clear EXIF data from files originals


Performance

-  to implement --no-rename option ...

-  decrease disk IO operations as possible

-  to implement possibility to work with other formats, which use EXIF
   mechanism (conversions by ImageMagick and/or netpbm as well as jpegtran)

+- implement aggregation option (to aggregate large bundle of files according
   the different time intervals, perhaps with some kind of euristics for
   analyzing the bigest time interval between shots)

-  to fix the feature with --aggr-template SOMENAME, when SOMENAME is dumb
   name, no % character and than renrot moves all to SOMENAME directory it'll
   be called OUTDIR

-  to implement possibility to work with several IN directories and to output
   to the set of OUT directories

-  avoid hard link making where in and out files on different partitions

-  check free space before start batch operation (probably find given file with
   maximum lenght and compare it with 1/3 of free space or 1/2 if --no-backup is
   defined)


User interface

-  GUI on PerlTk (due to WinCE hasn't real console) with some additional
   functions such as keywordizer

-  to implement help output by topics (sole -h outputs list of topics like
   rename,rotate,keyword e.t.c. and -h keyword outputs help for keyword related

q  integration with gallery


File naming

q  virtual renaming


Verbosity

q  to implement progress indicator or spinning indicator


Code

+- to review the code to optimize it where it's possible.

-  to tune style look of comments, code, e.t.c.


Other

-  to implement --include-file option (andy)

-  UTF8fy (comments, tags, ...) since it's not implemented in ExifTool yet
